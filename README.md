# Overview

This software was designed to be a UI for an audio recording manipulator. The main features include file upload and submission as well as manipulation. The web page takes a file input from a user, modifies it and sends the modified files to an external folder.

# Web Pages

So far in this project I have used only one web page, but I would like to add more pages to include transciption, and other future features.

# Development Environment

For this program I used lots of tools prep provided by Django such as, Forms, Messages, and URL manipulation.

I used a few different languages as well including Python, HTML, and CSS.
